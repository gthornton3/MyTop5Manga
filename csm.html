    <h2><font color = "#ff5d00"><u><center>Chainsaw Man</center></u></font></h2>
    <p>Chainsaw Man is basically about a boy and his dog. The boys name is Denji and the dogs name is Pochita. Denji is the main character of this story. He grew up most of his life alone and his only friend was Pochita. Pochita is a manifestation of the fear of chainsaws.</p>
    <p>The reason I chose Chainsaw Man to be on this list is because of the overall lore of this story and how complex it gets as the story goes on just makes its perfection.</p>
