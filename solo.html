    <h2><font color = "#000aff"><u><center>Solo Leveling</center></u></font></h2>
    <p>Solo Leveling is about a guy named Sung Jin-woo. He is a hunter. He hunts the monsters inside these gates that spawn all over the world. There are different rankings based on how much power each hunter has. Such as E Rank, D Rank, C Rank, B rank, A Rank, S Rank and the strongest and rarest of them all National-Level Hunters. He started off as an E-Rank and became stronger than any other hunter.</p>
    <p>This was chosen as my #2 because this anime takes a hero with no power and gives him more power than anyone could ever imagine.</p>
