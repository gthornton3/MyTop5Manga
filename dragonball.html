    <h2><font color = "orange"><u><center>Dragon Ball</center></u></font></h2>
    <p>Dragon Ball is one of the most well known mangas and anime of all time. Almost everyone thats heard of manga or anime has heard of Goku. Goku is the main character of this story. He was started his journey on Earth among the other humans although he doesn't know yet that he isnt human himself.</p>
    <p>This was chosen as my #4 because the amount of nostalgia and popularity that comes with it just adds on to the already amazing storyline.</p>
