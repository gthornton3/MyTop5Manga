    <h2><font color = "#9a9a9a"><u><center>Black Clover</center></u></font></h2>
    <p>This is the story of a boy named Asta who had nothing and gained it all. Meanwhile his brother Yuno was a born prodigy. Asta was born in a word full of magic, yet he was born without a single drop of magic within himself.</p>
    <p>The reason I chose Black Clover is because of how the boy goes from absolute zero to the hero that everyone needed most.</p>
