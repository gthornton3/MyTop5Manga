    <h2><font color = "red"><u><center>One Punch Man</center></u></font></h2>
    <p>This is a story about a normal guy named Saitama that broke past his limits and beats everyone else in strength and speed. Saitama gained all of his strength from nothing other than basic human exercising but he pushed past those limits.</p>
    <p>Last but definently not least, I chose One Punch Man as my #5. This comedic action anime is unlike no other and always brightens my day when I see it.</p>
